Hey there! I'm a Physics and Mechanical Engineering nerd at CMU. I like to:

* Design rockets with Carnegie Mellon Rocket Command as a Mechanical Lead
* Implement ML for 2D material detection under Professor Sufei Shi
* Cook high-quality documentation

I *know* `Python`, `Java`, and `JS`, but i *like* coding in `C++`.
Feel free to reach out to me at [pkaczmar@andrew.cmu.edu](pkaczmar@andrew.cmu.edu)!
